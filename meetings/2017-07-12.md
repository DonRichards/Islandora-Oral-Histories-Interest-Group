* What formats of subtitles does everyone have or prefer to use? TXT, WEBVTT, TTML, SRT? Why? How are they being generated?
* What kind of work are you doing surrounding oral histories? Any software development work?
* Staffing - who is involved in your oral histories workflows? How many people do you thikn you need?
* Handling some of the formatting options of WebVTT like italics, bold, and the class tags "<c>".  Also, this relates to how the WebVTT format is not legal to be used as HTML.

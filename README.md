# Islandora-Oral-Histories-Interest-Group
A place for the community to come together to share workflows, use cases, answer questions about capturing and storing oral histories in Islandora. You don't have to currently store oral histories, you may be considering it, you might be using [Islandora Oral Histories Solution Pack](https://github.com/digitalutsc/islandora_solution_pack_oralhistories), the [Islandora OHMS Solution Pack](https://github.com/ubermichael/islandora_solution_pack_ohms
), or you might be storing oral histories using an alternative method.

## Agenda

* Group Logistics
   * Timelines. This includes meeting frequency (monthly?),  duration of group - 3 months? 4 months? based on goals?
   * Assign Roles

* Discuss goals and priorities. What do you want to get out of this group? What kind of information do we want to share? Do we want to use this as a forum to troubleshoot technical issues, share workflows for making transcripts, etc? (Feel free to add your own for future discussion)
   * Overview of goals (discussing these in-depth will not happen during the kickoff, but we can list them then decide on a meeting timeline to discuss in future meetings)
   * General Goals
      * How is everyone creating transcripts? Are you auto-generating transcripts? Share tools (such as the Transcriptinator)
   * SFU
      * Who is using the [Islandora OHMS Solution Pack](https://github.com/ubermichael/islandora_solution_pack_ohms)?
   * UTSC Goals/Priorities
      * Who is using the solution pack? Can we add your name to an Affilitation or Users page in the Islandora Oral Histories Solution Pack README?
      * Side-by-side player - does anyone use this? We are consider deprecating support for this feature.
      * Any known bugs in the SP that have not yet been documented/addressed?
      * Any way to improve our tests? We currently aren't capturing all of the use cases for transcript ingest, such as native WebVTT ingest, use multiple WebVTTs, etc.

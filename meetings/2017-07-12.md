## Minutes
* Group Logistics Update
   * Interest Group meetings will start at 3pm EDT but may not necessarily last the whole hour. For the first part of the meetings, we will have a structured agenda, then the rest of the hour is more like a checkin and can be about anything. Can be troubleshooting modules, asking questions on how to get started with oral histories in Islandora, and more.
